[14:33:56] <Sebah> i have a quick question: I'm trying to run a local file into a web page ( ie: <source type="video/mp4" src="file:///O:/test.mp4"></source> ) and Chrome throws back the following error: 'Not allowed to load local resource: file:///O:/test.mp4'. Is there a way to tackle this? I know this issue is security related, but it'll be great if there would been a solution

Need a web server. I used python -m SimpleHTTPServer

BAM.
